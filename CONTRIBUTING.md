# Contributing to ideaSlackBot

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from .
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/VinceDerPrince/ideaSlackBot/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/VinceDerPrince/ideaSlackBot/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens

**Links to code that others can use to reproduce the issue** are hugely useful for helping me understand and fix the problem.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Please ensure your code adheres to this style guide before submitting a pull request. This includes following guidelines on formatting, naming conventions, and comments, among others.

You can use tools like [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) or [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) with the appropriate configuration to check your code for style issues. If you're using an integrated development environment (IDE), it may have built-in support for these tools.
